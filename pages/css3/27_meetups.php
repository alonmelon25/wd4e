  <h1>Meetups</h1>
  <p>Stop coding in the basement. Or the subway. Or your kids' messy playroom. It is time for you to go out and socialize with other web developers. Meetups are a great way to find other people who are interested in web development. You may find that you spend most of your time listening and absorbing the material, you may find that you are brave enough to ask questions. My secret hope is that you can go and act as a Teaching Assistant at a workshop. The important thing is to stay active in the field. Making potential work contacts doesn't hurt either.</p>
