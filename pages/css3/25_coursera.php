  <h1>Coursera Options</h1>
  <p>Surprise, surprise, I have two more courses as part of the Web Design Specialization. They are Adding Interactivity with JavaScript and Introduction to Responsive Design. These may not be out for a little bit though, and I would hate for you to lose your steam. So in the meantime, check out other options as well.</p>
