  <h1>OPTIONAL: A Change to the Accessibility of Headings</h1>
  <p>It used to be that the general rule was one h1 heading per page. However, with the advent of HTML5 and its many container elements (aside, section, article, etc.) this rule has changed. Here is a link to an interesting article that explains why multiple h1 headings will probably improve the accessibility and search engine optimization of your page.</p>

  <p>But just to be difficult, I will include this link to someone who disagrees.</p>
