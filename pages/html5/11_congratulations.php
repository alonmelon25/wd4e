  <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
  <p>Well done on taking the leap and learning more about the way web pages are created and transferred across the Internet. If you enjoyed this course and would like to take a next step you may be wondering where to go. This course is the first course in the Web Design for Everyone Specialization offered by Coursera. The other courses in this specialization include:</p>
  <br>
  <p>Introduction to CSS3</p>
  <p>In this course you will take simple HTML documents and use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to make them look less like the are from 1992 and more like the beautiful, well-designed sites you see today. All of the major aspects of styling will be covered, while still maintaining our focus on accessibility. In fact, designing with accessibility in mind takes on even greater importance since many people ignore the core principles and tend to use color, images, and font to convey information instead of using semantic tags.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Adding Interaction with JavaScript</p>
  <p>Every notice how some pages react to mouse clicks, screen swipes, or information you type into forms? This is often done using the JavaScript programming language. This course offers you an overview of the techniques and best practices for adding interaction to your site.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
  <p>Responsive design is the ability to design a site with multiple screen sizes (or "platforms") in mind. We have all been to a site that doesn't really work from a mobile device, or other sites that waste space by using small text on a big screen. In this course you will learn to design your site to automatically respond to the platform it is viewed on. Techniques include determining specific screen sizes yourself, or using popular template platforms such as Bootstrap to handle the responsive aspects for you.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Web Design for Everyone Capstone</p>
  <p>The capstone is your chance to fail. Again and again. Why would I put it that way? Because you can not really call yourself a web designer until you have had to test and debug your site multiple times. New information will not be covered in this course, instead you will be given weekly checkpoints as you design, code, and debug your own responsive, interactive site. The emphasis on accessibility will remain. Upon completion of the capstone you will have a portfolio-ready site.</p>
