  <h1>Putting Your Code Out on to the Web</h1>
  <p>The videos in this next section are intended for those students who want to post their websites to the Web. Until now you have been viewing your files <b><i>locally</i></b>. This means that the browser isn't sending a Request to a server, but rather just retrieving a file from your computer. (This is why the protocol in the address bar is <b>file</b>, not <b>http</b>). So go ahead and watch the 'Hosting Your Files' video but feel free to skip the lectures on cPanel and SFTP if you don't plan on hosting your files on the web. You can always change your mind and host them later.</p>
