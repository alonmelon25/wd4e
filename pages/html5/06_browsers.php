  <h1>Browsers</h1>
  <p>Browsers are constantly changing. Changing so much that it is difficult to keep up with all of the changes once you pick a favorite. Myself? I got a Mac a few years ago and have been using Chrome. But oftentimes I switch to Firefox because it allows me to run some programs that Chrome has trouble with. <b>So please remember that many times a page that doesn't work in one browser will work in another.</b> It is a great time saver if you make sure to have two on your computer so that you can do a quick check if you ever get stuck on a site.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In the lecture video I will do my best to touch on some of the most popular browsers. But I am including here a link to an optional reading on the "best" browsers of 2018. This is an optional reading because I don't like the popups that accompany it.</p>

  <p>Some people are very loyal to their browsers, any of my comments here are just my views! I hope that we have taken some of the mystery away from how browsers work and why there are so many.</p>
