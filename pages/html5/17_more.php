  <h1>Watch for a link for more material</h1>
  <p>Keep an eye out for an email from me once you complete this course. In the email I will include a link to the "Secret Lecture" I taped for you. In this lecture I break some of my own rules of coding and show you simple (but not best-practice) tips on styling your final project to make it more attractive. So if you haven't finished the final project, <i>how can you possibly procrastinate now that you know there is a secret lecture???</i></p>
