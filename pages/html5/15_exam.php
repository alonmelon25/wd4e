  <h1>The Final Exam has changed.</h1>
  <p>Hi all,</p>
  <p>Don't worry, the assignment is still the same, just the way you are going to submit it. The first question is the original question where you are going to copy and paste your code into the autograder. It is incredibly difficult to get an exact match. So I have added eight additional questions. Each way relates specifically to the assignment. You need to choose the best match for each code segment. If you get these ones correct, you can still pass the course. Consider the first question a challenge.</p>
