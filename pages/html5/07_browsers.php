  <h1>Browsers</h1>
  <p>Browsers are constantly changing. Changing so much that it is difficult to keep up with all of the changes once you pick a favorite. Myself? I got a Mac a few years ago and have been using Chrome. This means I missed two important things (if not more) in my Browsers video. First, Apple discontinued Safari support for Windows back in 2012. Second, Microsoft has a new browser called Edge that was released in 2015.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Some people are very loyal to their browsers, any of my comments here are just my views!</p>
