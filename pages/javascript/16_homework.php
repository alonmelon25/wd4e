  <h1>Homework Two</h1>
  <p>I am going to provide an optional quiz for people who want to double check how well they have retained some of the general concepts from Week Two.</p>
  <br>
  <p>What I really want people to focus on though is the Photo Gallery assignment. All of the components you need to complete this program are in the video lectures, it is your job to put them together. Please note, the answer can be as little as 4 or 5 lines of code, or much more if that makes more sense to you. While you are welcome to seek out help on the forums, please remember that you are not allowed to post code. The code to get you started is here: <a href="http://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/wKYxZa">http://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/wKYxZa</a></p>

  <p>Good luck!</p>
