  <h1>Note</h1>
  <p>In the middle of creating this course I had a "trip and fall" accident where I tripped over my own feet. There will be a number of videos in the rest of this course where you may notice that my face is bruised/scarred. I only mention this so that it won't distract from what I hope you will learn.</p>
  <p>I appreciate any concern people may have, but I want to assure you that I am fine. I would appreciate keeping the topic off the discussion board. The big lesson to take away from this is to avoid carrying five or six programming books in your backpack, because they can really throw off your balance.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Thanks!</p>
