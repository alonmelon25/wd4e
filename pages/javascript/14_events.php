  <h1>Events</h1>
  <p>The rest of the material is more and more examples of using Events and functions in JavaScript. If you are a little worried that you don't understand them after the first video, that is fine. Just watch the videos all the way through, try to play with some of the code, and then watch the videos again. It isn't uncommon for it to take a few weeks to make sense. Since we only have four weeks in those course you may find that you are sometimes able to make the code work, without fully understanding the details. That happens a lot. Programming is something that comes with time and practice. And then suddenly the moments of "Hooray" start to outnumber the times that you are stuck.</p>
