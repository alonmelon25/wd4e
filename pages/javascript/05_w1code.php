  <h1>Link to All of the Code for Week One</h1>
  <p><a href="http://codepen.io/collection/nLPkgP/">http://codepen.io/collection/nLPkgP/</a></p>
  <p>Here is a link to a collection of all of the Code for Week One. (There may be a few extra files in there as I play with new examples.) Each individual file is also linked below the lecture videos to help you match the code with the lecture. I find that it can be annoying to use CodePen for the first few lectures since it causes a lot of pop-up boxes. Don't worry, we move away from that by Week Two.</p>
  <p>Even if you use CodePen, I encourage you to practice writing the code on your own. For now, I put complete examples in CodePen, but as time goes on I will remove some of the commands to link the code together. You will need to work on that part on your own.</p>
