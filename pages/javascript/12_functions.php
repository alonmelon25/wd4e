  <h1>Functions</h1>
  <p>The next video on functions is crucial to any type of programming that you may do in the future. The reason that programming languages work so well is that they allow people to reuse work that other people have done. Someone else writes the complex code that can determine what time it is in any given country? Excellent. If they put that code in a function then you can use it without really knowing the details of how it works. (And yes, there is a function for that.)</p>
  <p>One of the things I want you to watch for in this video is the distinction between <b><i><u>defining</u></i></b> a function (writing the code) and <b><i><u>calling</u></i></b> a function (running the code at the precise time you want it to happen).</p>
