  <h1>Using Forms on Your Site</h1>
  <p>As I mentioned earlier, the forms we are making right now are a great way to work with JavaScript, but you wouldn't want to put these forms on your page since you don't know how to deal with the information that people may send. Luckily, now that you know a little about forms you are in a great place to utilize free form builders. Many people already use Google Forms to create online forms. Another great place that I would recommend is WUFOO <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/">http://www.wufoo.com/</a>. This site is highly recommended for deploying forms.</p>
