  <h1>Introduction to Forms</h1>
  <p>This week we will cover forms. You have all seen forms (we use them for the peer assessment) and I want you to know how to style forms and perform some "validation" - checks on the input. Form validation is a valuable and extremely common way to incorporate JavaScript into your site.</p>
  <p>But I need you to know that we are only going to talk about half of what you need to know to use forms. When someone hits the Submit button on our forms we don't do anything with it. So if you decide to later make your own site you will not want to create your own form....otherwise people will think that they are sending you information when they are not.</p>
