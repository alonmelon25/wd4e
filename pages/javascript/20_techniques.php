  <h1>Advanced Coding Techniques</h1>
  <p>In the next few lectures we will talk about more advanced coding techniques. Any programming language has the general ability to loop (run the same code multiple times) and to make decisions during "run time." The important thing to know is that while the concepts are the same among programming languages, they all do it a little differently. Some use parentheses, some don't. Some rely on indentation, others don't.</p>
  <p>The important thing is to understand the LOGIC. Doing just the examples we provide here aren't enough, you will want to change your code to come up with new decisions and different criteria to test different situations.</p>
