  <h1>A JavaScript Cheat Sheet</h1>
  <p>I thought about putting this next link in the optional resources section, but it is something I really want people to know about. This "Cheat Sheet" covers the major essentials of the JavaScript language. Some of it we have covered, and some we will cover in the next two weeks. And then there is a chunk we will never get to.</p>

  <p>So why do I want to share this with you? As you learn to program it is important to step back every once and awhile and review what you have learned AND what you still have left to learn. It helps a lot of people to look ahead and start to see that they need to master the small stuff before they can tackle the larger concepts.</p>
