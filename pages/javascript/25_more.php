  <h1>More Code Examples</h1>
  <p>You will want to check out the CodePen examples for Week Four. There are some examples in there that will help you as you attempt to complete the next homework assignment. It is important to know that you may need to do a little bit of looking to figure it out. I would definitely start with the <a href="https://codepen.io/ColleenEMc/pen/dYLEjw">JS - Checkbox Example</a>. The big difference is that in the homework we will be changing the value attributes on your fields.</p>
