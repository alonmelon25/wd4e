  <h1>Help us learn more about you!</h1>
  <p>As part of getting to know you better, your backgrounds, your interest in this specific course and in digital education in general, we at the University of Michigan have crafted a survey that should only take a few minutes to complete. Our goal is to keep our communication with you focused on learning and staying in touch, but we believe that both this and an end-of-course survey are important to our mutual educational goals.</p>
